# Drug-Discovery
This project is my attempt to explore how machine learning can support drug discovery, especially by working with a dataset of Cathepsin S mutants. The idea was to understand how different chemical properties relate to drug activity and build a model that could help predict which compounds might be effective.
What I Did:
Cleaned and prepared the data for modeling

Used algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost to predict compound activity

Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy and ROC-AUC

Visualized key insights to better understand whatâ€™s driving predictions

Tools I Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook

Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting

Why It Matters:
Drug discovery is complex and expensive. This project shows how data science can help narrow down potential candidates faster, saving both time and resources in early research stages.
